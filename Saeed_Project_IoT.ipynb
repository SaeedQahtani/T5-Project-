    "The goal of this project is to use classification models for botnet detection in IoT environment in order to improve the IoT network security. In addtion, leveraging categorical feature engineering along with a supervised learning algorithms, logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest to achieve promising results for this problem. \n",

The network environment incorporated a combination of normal and botnet traffic. Further information can be found at https://research.unsw.edu.au/projects/bot-iot-dataset \n",
